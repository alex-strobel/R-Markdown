# R-Markdown

Welcome to our introductory R Markdown course! R Markdown is a simple and an easy to learn formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. In combination with a handful of LaTeX commands, R Markdown allows to create updatable and reproducible reports because one analyzes data and report the results in one instance and in a dynamic manner. That is, if one later makes some analysis decision that will affect all downstream analyses (such as removing an outlier), the document will be dynamically updated including all now perhaps changed results. In principle, having a handful of data from a pilot study, one can write the Intruduction and Methods section of a scientifc manuscript in R Markdown, all analysis routines in R code, and by placing references to objects generated by this code (such as a linear model) in the text body of the results section, one can even write up the whole results section without even having started to collect the  the
