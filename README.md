# R-Markdown

Welcome to our introductory R Markdown course! R Markdown is a simple and an easy to learn formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. R Markdown allows to create updatable and reproducible reports because one analyzes data and reports the results in one instance and in a dynamic manner. In principle, having a handful of data from a pilot study, you can write the Introduction and Methods section of a scientifc manuscript in R Markdown language (with a little help from LaTeX), all analysis routines in R code, and by placing references to objects generated by this code (such as a linear model) in the text body of the results section, you can even write up the whole Results section without even having started to collect the actual data. In this course, you will learn how to do so. We provide you with a number of RMarkdown lessons, each lesson ending with some exercises. Anyone taking this course should try to come up with solutions to the exercises before sneaking into the solutions that we also provide.       

## Folder structure

[01_Lessons/](01_Lessons/)           - so far three lessons to familiarize you with RMarkdown and LaTeX<br>
[02_Solutions/](02_Solutions/)       - solutions to the exercises at the end of each lesson<br>
[03_Resources/](03_Resources/)       - further resources (so far not fully functional)<br>
[renv/](renv/)                       - contains a file to initiate the R environment of this course<br>
[renv.lock](renv.lock)               - a list of R packages automatically downloaded and attached to the course's environment<br>
[activateCourse.R](activateCourse.R) - R script for activating the course via renv or via manual setup

## How to use this repository

In order to take this course, first navigate to the folder where you want the course to be stored and RMarkdwon files to be executed. Then clone this repository from the RStudio console via the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/alex-strobel/R-Markdown.git` 

In RStudio, open activateCourse.R and follow the instructions (please note that to setup your environment may take a few minutes). Then open 01_Lessons/RM_01_GettingStarted.Rmd for ... ahm ... getting started!

## Required software

To use R Markdown, you need to have installed the following software (the links take you to the respective download sites)

- [The R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 

The R Project provides an _Introduction to R_, but it is not a short read. For a denser overview on the basics of R, you may want to use the cheat sheet below:

- [Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)
- [Base R Cheat Sheet](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf)

So far, we could not find a both useful *and* visually appealing introduction, just ask Google if you do not find RStudio's GUI self-explaining.

## Helpful R Markdown guides

While we will try our best to provide you with our knowledge on R markdown, we consider us still as novices ourselves. So, it may pay to read the R Markdown guide, and often enough, you may want to refer to the R Markdown Cheat Sheet:

- [R Markdown Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
- [RMarkdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

Because later on in this course, we will also use the R package *papaja* dedicated to use R Markdown for writing psychological articles in APA style (so far only available for its 6th edition), one needs to install it as described on the author's GitHub site and it may pay to familiarize yourself with the manual:
