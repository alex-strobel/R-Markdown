_Self-Control_ was measured using the short form of the German Self-Control Scale [SCS-K-D; @Bertrams2009] that comprises 13 items (e.g., “I am able to work effectively toward long-term goals”) with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from -2 (completely disagree) to +2 (completely agree). The scale shows comparably high reliability [Cronbach’s $\alpha$  ~ .80, 7-week retest reliability $r_{tt}$  = .82; @Bertrams2009].
