_Need for Cognition_ was assessed with the 16-item short version of the German NFC scale [@Bless1994]. Responses to each item (e.g., "Thinking is not my idea of fun", recoded) were recorded on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from -3 (completely disagree) to +3 (completely agree). The scale shows comparably high internal consistency [Cronbachâ€™s $\alpha$ > .80; @Bless1994; @Fleischhauer2010].
